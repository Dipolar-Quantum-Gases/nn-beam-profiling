# Measuring Laser Beams with a Neural Network

This is code associated with the paper "[Measuring Laser Beams with a Neural Network](https://doi.org/10.1364/AO.443531)." An ArXiv version of the paper is also available.

Currently the repo has a Google Colab notebook which demonstrates how to download and use the simulated and experimental datasets from the paper. The datasets are located in an Oxford University Research Archive and can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.5287/bodleian:JbDXrnQN1).

We will additionally be adding code in the near future on how to train Detectron2 to detect and measure laser beams from the datasets.
